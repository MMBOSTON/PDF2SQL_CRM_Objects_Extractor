MMBOSTON: conda install pdfplumber pandas 

GitHub Copilot: ```plaintext
conda install -c conda-forge pdfplumber pandas
```

MMBOSTON: conda-forge install of pdfplumber taking forever. Should I do pip install?

GitHub Copilot: Yes, if the `conda` installation from the `conda-forge` channel is taking an unusually long time or seems to be stuck, using `pip` as an alternative can be a good option. `pip` is Python's package installer and can install packages from the Python Package Index (PyPI), where `pdfplumber` and [`pandas`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FProgramData%2FAnaconda3%2Fenvs%2Fsnowfakery_env%2FLib%2Fsite-packages%2Fpandas%2F__init__.py%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A0%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%5D "../../../../../ProgramData/Anaconda3/envs/snowfakery_env/Lib/site-packages/pandas/__init__.py") are available. Here's how you can do it:

```plaintext
pip install pdfplumber pandas
```

MMBOSTON: can you review the attached python script and write a detail overview on what it is, what does it do and how does it function.......so I can add into my README.md file?

GitHub Copilot: This Python script, named [`pdf2sql_extractor.py`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FUsers%2F16175%2FDocuments%2FGitHub%2FPDF2SQL_CRM_Objects_Extractor%2Fpdf2sql_extractor.py%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "c:\Users\16175\Documents\GitHub\PDF2SQL_CRM_Objects_Extractor\pdf2sql_extractor.py"), is designed to extract table structures from PDF documents and convert them into various formats suitable for database schema creation and data analysis. The script performs several key functions, including reading tables from a PDF, cleaning and organizing the data, and outputting the results in text, SQL schema, and CSV formats. Here's a detailed overview of its functionality and operation:

### Overview

The script is a comprehensive tool for extracting structured table data from PDF files, specifically focusing on tables that represent database schemas or similar structured data. It is particularly useful for converting legacy documents or reports into actionable database schemas or for data analysis purposes.

### Functionality

1. **PDF Table Extraction**: It uses the [`pdfplumber`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FProgramData%2FAnaconda3%2Fenvs%2Fstreamlit_apps%2FLib%2Fsite-packages%2Fpdfplumber%2F__init__.py%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A0%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%5D "../../../../../ProgramData/Anaconda3/envs/streamlit_apps/Lib/site-packages/pdfplumber/__init__.py") library to open and read through each page of a specified PDF document, extracting text and identifying tables based on predefined patterns (e.g., lines starting with "Table" followed by "Table structure for table").

2. **Data Cleaning and Organization**: After extraction, the script organizes the data into tables, cleans it by removing unwanted lines (e.g., footers), and prepares it for further processing. It identifies table names and their corresponding columns and data rows.

3. **Output Generation**:
   - **Text File**: Generates a `.txt` file containing the cleaned and organized table data in a readable format.
   - **SQL Schema**: Creates a `.sql` file with SQL `CREATE TABLE` statements for each extracted table, mapping data types from the PDF to SQLite compatible types.
   - **CSV File**: Produces a `.csv` file listing all tables, columns, and their attributes (e.g., type, nullability, default values) for easy import into spreadsheet software or databases.

### How It Functions

1. **Logging Setup**: Configures logging to output both to the terminal and a log file, facilitating debugging and tracking of the script's execution.

2. **Table Extraction Process**:
   - Opens the PDF file and iterates through each page.
   - Splits page text by lines and processes each line to identify table names and their data, skipping irrelevant lines.
   - Accumulates tables and their names for further processing.

3. **Data Cleaning and Merging**:
   - Cleans the extracted table data by separating column headers from data rows.
   - Merges tables if necessary (though the current implementation prepares for this without explicitly performing merges).

4. **Schema Generation and Output**:
   - Generates an SQLite-compatible schema from the cleaned table data, mapping MySQL data types to SQLite types.
   - Writes the cleaned data to a text file, the schema to a SQL file, and a summary of tables and columns to a CSV file.

5. **Main Function**: Orchestrates the process by calling the extraction, cleaning, and output generation functions with specified file paths.

### Conclusion

This script is a powerful tool for automating the extraction of structured data from PDF documents into formats that are immediately useful for database schema creation and data analysis. It streamlines the process of converting static documents into dynamic, actionable formats, saving time and reducing manual data entry errors.

### CRUD OPERATIONS

# Pseudocode for the provided Python file (crud_operations.py)

1. Import necessary libraries and modules.
2. Set up logging to both terminal and file.
3. Define the Base class for SQLAlchemy ORM.
4. Define the CrmAccount class with its attributes and table structure.
5. Create an engine and session for the SQLite database.
6. Define a function to get the next ID for a new account.
7. Define CRUD operations for the CrmAccount:
    - Create a new account.
    - Read an account by ID.
    - Update an account by ID.
    - Delete an account by ID.
8. Define functions for schema modification and migration:
    - Check if a column exists in a table.
    - Add a column to a table if it doesn't exist.
    - Migrate the database to create all tables defined in the Base metadata.
9. Define additional utility functions:
    - Get all accounts.
    - Get accounts by type, name, industry, city.
    - Count the total number of accounts.
    - Get recent accounts based on a specified number of days.
    - Activate or deactivate an account.
    - Get inactive accounts.
10. Define a function to create test accounts for demonstration purposes.
11. Define a function to verify CRUD operations by creating, reading, updating, and deleting an account.
12. In the main execution block:
     - Create a session.
     - Create test accounts.
     - Verify CRUD operations.
     - Perform various queries to demonstrate the utility functions.
     - Close the session.
